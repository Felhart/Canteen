# Canteen POS - A Modern Point-of-Sale System



A simple and modern Point of Sale (POS) application for managing a small canteen, cafe, or shop, built with Python. This project uses **CustomTkinter** for a sleek, modern user interface and **SQLite** for robust, local data storage.

## Key Features

- **Intuitive Sales Screen (POS):**
    - **Fast Barcode Integration:** Supports 13-digit barcode scanning for instant product lookup and automatic entry.
    - **Keyboard-Optimized Workflow:** Add items with the `Space` key and finalize sales with `Enter` for a completely mouse-free, rapid checkout experience.
    - **Live Cart Management:** Easily reduce item quantities or remove them from the cart before finalizing a sale.

- **Comprehensive Inventory Management:**
    - **Add & Edit Products:** A dedicated interface to add new products with barcode, name, price, and initial stock.
    - **Live Stock Updates:** Stock levels are automatically decremented after each confirmed sale.
    - **Inline Editing:** Double-click any cell (except barcode) in the inventory list to quickly edit product details directly in the table.

- **Powerful Reporting & Analytics:**
    - **Transaction History (Receipt View):** Browse a complete history of all past sales and click on any sale to see the detailed contents of that specific receipt.
    - **Product-Based Analytics:** Generate detailed reports for any date range to see which products are selling the most, including total units sold and the total revenue generated by each product.

- **Modern & User-Friendly Interface:**
    - Built with **CustomTkinter** for a clean, modern look and feel.
    - Comes with a pre-configured dark theme that is easy on the eyes.
    - Responsive design elements that adapt to different window sizes.

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python 3
- **GUI Framework:** [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter)
- **Database:** SQLite 3
- **Calendar Widget:** [tkcalendar](https://pypi.org/project/tkcalendar/)
- **Image Handling:** Pillow

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation & Setup
1.  **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Felhart/Canteen.git

    ```bash
    pip install customtkinter pillow tkcalendar
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**

    The application will automatically create a `canteen.db` SQLite database file in the project directory on its first run.

## Future Development Roadmap
